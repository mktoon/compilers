/*structure of the symbol table
C requires us to declare prototypes before we use them
symtab members - remove label -we will use it in the calculator
INT x =0, y=1,z =2
two pointers first and last defaults to null

main 
takes input
calls a function in each case
size of symbol will always be 
all interactions with user have to be in the main function
main asks for symbol and a number
construct label should be done by the time we a re done

Ctrl C

*symbol defaults to null
when main gets called it creates an activatio
points to the same spot in memory

symbol = stringdup(input) - we do this if we do not want to loose it
read into the local memory
